Broadcasting control is enabled through computers in class and the Bluetooth multimedia collar microphone attached to the teacher. The pricing of the platform offers an advantage to learning institutions as it does not include a licensing model per device, person or access and instead, enables unlimited growth. LCSP can also be operated on IP based cameras, smart boards, Bluetooth multimedia microphones, Mac based PC’s and IP based networks.

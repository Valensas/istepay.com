Users get together with Social Media integration and post about their BMW Rider Academy events.

On their dashboard screen they can see where they are on the map with geolocation, their current and average speed. Also a compass shows which direction they are heading. Riders can also set an alarm to warn them when they have reached their targeted speed. One click HELP button calls the BMW call center also in conjunction with emailing them your location.

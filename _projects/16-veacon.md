This app is for showing people how capable our Veacon service is. Users can login with their veacon.com account. The app has following modes:

- Be a Veacon: The mobile device would simulate a Veacon sensor. Users can use it while configuring and testing scenarios in this mode before buying actual Veacon sensors.

- Detect Veacon - The app will act as a fully integrated Veacon app. All nearby Veacon sensors and mobile devices act as Veacon sensors will be tracked continuously. Therefore, all the scenarios can be used.
